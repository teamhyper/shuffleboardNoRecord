# shuffleboardNoRecord

## description
stop the shuffleboard recording as soon as the plugins loads

you can always start recording when you want to, pressing the button like normal

shuffleboard didn't go to preschool, so is bad at sharing RAM. 

rather than needing to remember to stop recording everytime we load shuffleboard (and a bit more elegant than just commenting out a single line in shuffleboard source and building our own .jar), this plugin just stops the recording when it loads.

## installation
[download the jar](https://github.com/teamhyper/shuffleboardNoRecord/releases/latest) to `{USERDIR}\Shuffleboard\plugins`
