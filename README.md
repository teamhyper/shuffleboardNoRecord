# shuffleboardNoRecord

## description
shuffleboard didn't go to preschool, so is bad at sharing RAM

stop the shuffleboard recording as soon as the plugins loads. 

rather than needing to remember to stop recording everytime we load shuffleboard (and a bit more elegant than just commenting out a single line in shuffleboard source and building our own .jar), this plugin just stops the recording when it loads. you can always start recording whenever you want to, clicking the record button like normal.

## installation
[download the jar](https://github.com/teamhyper/shuffleboardNoRecord/releases/latest) to `{USERDIR}\Shuffleboard\plugins`
